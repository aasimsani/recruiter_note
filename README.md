# Recruiter note!
Hi Potential Recruiter! - Looking for my code?

You're looking at my Github and seeing that it's a bit sparse on public projects. :(

Unfortunately most of my coding career has been writing code for my own startups which due to legal reasons are private repos. 

Happy to share these if you shoot me an email at aasimsani05 at gmail.com

However here's a few highlights:
1. [Artificial Manga Panel Dataset](https://github.com/aasimsani/artificial_manga_panel_dataset) and it's [accompanying AI model repo](https://github.com/aasimsani/ampd-ml.git) - Top 10 Projects Fullstack Deep Learning Class of Spring 2021
2. [Machine Learning Project Template](https://github.com/aasimsani/ml_project_template.git)
3. [Hack Princeton 2018 Winning project](https://github.com/aasimsani/hackprinceton2018-fall.git)
